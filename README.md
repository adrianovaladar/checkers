# checkers

Checkers game developed in Java 19. JavaFX is needed.

It is a standalone program, player vs player. A preview of the game:

There is a menu that allows the players to change their names and two buttons, one to start a game and the other to give up from the current game. The area that is in the right of the board displays the history of the game.

Enjoy!
